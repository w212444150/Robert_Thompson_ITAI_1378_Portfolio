# CNN Fundamentals: Chihuahua vs. Muffin

## Problem Statement
A binary classification challenge distinguishing between Chihuahuas and Muffins, which share similar visual textures and colors.

## Approach
Built a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. Experimented with Learning Rates (0.5 vs 0.01) and optimizer selection (AdamW vs SGD).

## Key Findings
- **Overfitting:** High training accuracy vs low validation accuracy indicated the model was memorizing rather than learning.
- **Architecture:** "More isn't always better." Adding too many layers introduced noise.

## Dataset
Used the [Patitimoner/workshop-chihuahua-vs-muffin](https://github.com/patitimoner/workshop-chihuahua-vs-muffin) dataset.

## Technologies Used
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
