# Robert_Thompson_ITAI_1378_Portfolio

**I went from running communications in combat under fire to training machines to see.**

I am a former Airborne Infantryman with a background in tactical communications and multiple combat deployments. I know firsthand that on the battlefield, situational awareness is everything. If you can't see the threat, you can't stop it.

I am pivoting that experience into **AI for Cybersecurity and Autonomous Systems**. I am currently focused on Computer Vision (CV) applications—specifically how we can use software like **Anduril’s Lattice** to turn dumb sensors into smart assets. My goal is to build systems that process visual data faster than a human operator ever could, whether for drone defense or threat detection.

This repository documents my progress through **Computer Vision (ITAI 1378)**, moving from basic pixel manipulation to building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

**I uploaded my code files to Word for grammar, font and simply more efficient editing, then paste into my repo without having to worry about grammatical errors. I always have one or... ∞ **
