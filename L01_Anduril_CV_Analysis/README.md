# Industry Case Study: Anduril Industries

## Problem Statement
Modern defense requires "persistent autonomous awareness." Human operators cannot monitor video feeds 24/7 without fatigue.

## Analysis
I analyzed Anduril Industries and their "Lattice" OS.
- **Technology:** Uses edge detection for background separation and histogram equalization for variable lighting.
- **Ethical Finding:** There is a critical trade-off between the safety provided by autonomous surveillance and privacy/civil liberties.

## Technologies
- Edge Detection Algorithms
- Histogram Equalization
- Autonomous Drone Surveillance (Ghost-X)
