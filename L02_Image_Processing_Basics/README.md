# Image Processing Fundamentals

## Problem Statement
Learned that computers "see" images by manipulating raw pixel matrices (0-255) without using high-level AI wrappers, software on top of existing AI models like Claude, ChatGPT, etc., that tailors the functions depending on specific use cases.

## Approach
Implemented 15+ operations using OpenCV and NumPy, including channel splitting, grayscale conversion, and contrast adjustment.

## Key Findings
- **Math = Magic:** Brightness is addition; Contrast is multiplication.
- **Optimization:** Vectorized NumPy operations are much faster than pixel loops.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
