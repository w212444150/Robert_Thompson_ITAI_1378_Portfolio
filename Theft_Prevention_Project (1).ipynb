Real CCTV footage is rarely available due to privacy and liability concerns, and publicly annotated datasets for behaviors like touching exhibits or leaning over barriers are almost nonexistent. Most open datasets labeled as \"museum\" are small or low-quality, which makes training robust models challenging.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Future Application in Museums\n","\n","- **Train on museum-specific datasets:** Including visitor interactions with exhibits and staged theft attempts.  \n","- **Implement real-time detection:** Integrate CCTV or security camera feeds to detect suspicious behavior immediately.  \n","- **Handle challenging scenarios:** Low light, occlusions, and crowded spaces.  \n","- **Potential behavior analysis:** Optional pose detection for detecting grabbing or reaching motions.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","### Impact\n","This preparatory model demonstrates a **working AI pipeline** that can be extended to **enhance security and prevent theft in museums**.
